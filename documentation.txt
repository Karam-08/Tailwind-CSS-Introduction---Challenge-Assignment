Tailwind CSS is an open source CSS framework.

Unlike other frameworks like Bootstrap, there are no predefined classes for elements such as buttons or tables. Instead, it creates a list of "utility" CSS classes.

Utility classes are single purpose classes that apply styles directly to the HTML elements.
